# canvas : HTML5 canvas files

This small collection of HTML, CSS and JavaScript files is intended to help *complete beginners* learn how to use canvas. You can [see the live Web pages](http://www.macloo.com/examples/canvas/).

You can [view an introduction](http://www.slideshare.net/macloo/introduction-to-html5-canvas) to the canvas on SlideShare.

Each example is very simple. Each one represents one small step toward learning to use the canvas. Most of the HTML pages include links to relevant tutorials.
