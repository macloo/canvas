canvas Exercises
================

The files in this folder are downloaded by my students and used interactively while I show a PowerPoint to introduce the HTML5 canvas to them. They have already spent several weeks on learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This is their first exposure to the canvas.

Here is the PowerPoint on Slideshare: [Introduction to HTML5 canvas](http://www.slideshare.net/macloo/introduction-to-html5-canvas). You can download it there. When you view the PPT, you'll see explicit instructions about which files to open and what to do with them.

You can download all the exercise files (and nothing else) here: [https://bit.ly/mm_canvas](https://bit.ly/mm_canvas)
